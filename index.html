                    <div class="postcard__preview-txt">In 2019 I was heavily involved with the PC Madden 19 modding community. At first, I was involved with roster creation and updates, doing research on players, adjusting ratings, and copying real-life roster moves into the game. This roster was titled “Volvo’s Roster”, and it would become the roster used in the incredibly popular “Start Today” mod. My crowning achievement, though, was figuring out how to edit the scoreboards and visual team graphics. At the time, Madden 19 was the first PC Madden release since 2007’s Madden 08. The engine that M19 used, Frostbite, was just being reverse engineered by Frosty and his team. Working with members in the PC FIFA modding community, I was able to reverse engineer how team visual graphics were stored and loaded in the Frostbite engine. Using this same tactic, I was also able to change the scoreboard in the game. I created a tutorial for this process, and the tutorial became incredibly popular within the modding community. This work that I did, while almost entirely uncredited, would become foundational for every custom team or custom scoreboard mod that was made for Madden 19. I also received special thanks from the “College Football 19” mod team, and this mod was covered by Game Informer upon its release.</div>

                    <div class="postcard__preview-txt">In August of 2022 I was hired as a Zone Support Analyst at the Help Desk at Boise State University. In February of 2023, I received the promotion to Zone Tech. While as Zone Tech, I am the primary point of contact for advanced student troubleshooting issues. I work closely with the CISO team to ensure that the eduroam network is as safe as possible, removing viruses and disallowed programs (i.e. torrenting clients) from marked user devices. I am also the primary point of contact for VIP troubleshooting in the Zone, as well as being the person who provides in-person technical support for events that fall within the Zone’s owned rooms and technologies. My greatest achievement while at the Zone has been solving various Eduroam connectivity issues. In the summer of 2023, the network security certificate was reissued. After the certificate was reissued, any Apple device running anything older than the newest MacOS or iOS at the time (Ventura and 17 respectively), would not receive the certificate when attempting to connect to Eduroam. I figured out that while reissuing the certificate, the Cisco Identity Service Engine also ran an update to serve certificates via NSURLSession, which was not supported by any other version of MacOS/iOS. I also discovered the workaround, which was downloading the root and intermediate root certificates directly from DigiCert.</div>
